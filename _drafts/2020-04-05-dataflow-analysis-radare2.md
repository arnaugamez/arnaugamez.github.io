## Context

Dataflow analyisis...



### Forward

Reachable definition analysis -> Constant propagation (+ some folding if needed)

Theory

Simple example

### Backward

Liveness analysis

Theory

Simple example

### Combined

Do forward to propagate. Will lead to dead code to appear. 

### Problems

Branch (flow), opaque predicates.
