Hi there! I am _Arnau GÃ mez i Montolio_, a catalan hacker, reverse engineer and mathematician.

I do security research within a broad range of interests, but recently I have been particularly focused in:
- Malware analysis
- Code (de)obfuscation
- Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) expressions

Co-founder and president of [Hacking Lliure](https://twitter.com/HackingLliure), a catalan non-profit association about digital rights, open source and security awareness.
