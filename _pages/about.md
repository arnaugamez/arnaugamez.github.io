Hi there! My name is Arnau GÃ mez i Montolio, from lovely Barcelona. I am currently finishing my studies in both Mathematics and Computer Engineering. 

Passionate about hacking and information security since I can remember. Recently I have been particularly interested in the field of reverse (code) engineering, including but not limited to:

- Malware analysis
- Vulnerability research and exploit development
- Binary formats
- Code (de)obfuscation

I am also associated with the following groups
