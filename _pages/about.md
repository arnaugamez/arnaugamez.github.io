Hi there! I am _Arnau GÃ mez i Montolio_, a reverse engineer and mathematician from lovely Barcelona.

My interests are broad, but recently I have been particularly focused on:
- Code (de)obfuscation
- Malware analysis
- Binary formats
- Cryptography

Co-founder and president of [Hacking Lliure](https://twitter.com/HackingLliure), a catalan non-profit association about digital rights, open source and security awareness.

I also hold a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering.
