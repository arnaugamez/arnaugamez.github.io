Hi there! My name is Arnau GÃ mez i Montolio, from lovely Barcelona.

I am passionate about hacking and information security since I can remember. Recently I have been particularly interested in the field of reverse engineering, including but not limited to:

- Code (de)obfuscation
- Malware analysis
- Binary formats
- Cryptography
- Vulnerability research and exploit development

I also hold a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering.
